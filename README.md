# Inline suggestions plugin for [Zim Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org)

## Functionality

### Tag suggestions

The plugin provides suggestions for tag names after entering a `@` in the page editor.
The suggestions are based on the tags used throughout the notebook and presented in alphabetical order.
The suggestions are iteratively refined based on the name already entered (i.e., the text between between the `@` and the cursor).

To accept a suggestion, press `Return`. `Esc` kills the suggestions popup. Continuing with `Space` finishes the entered tag name, ignoring the suggestions.

## Installing

This plugin can be installed by cloning this repository into your Zim `plugins` folder. Alternatively, the files can be downloaded as ZIP and unpacked in your Zim `plugins` folder.

After installing, activate the plugin in the setting dialog.
